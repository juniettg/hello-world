# hello-world
Hello! Here is my first repository on Github. Yay for learning!
I am readily known as Juniett, but I typically address myself as JG, girl, and junibee.
There are an assortment of things I enjoy.
I'd probably say that I am someone who is very likeable, and loves to laugh. Someone who seeks to learn new things
but also has a lot of trouble actually doing those things..But that's besides the point!
My brain works in quirky little ways that only make sense to me. For example I was strongly incline to spell "pointe" instead.
Okay, byee
